# Bhavya Gupta - Interactive Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a fully animated, single-page application designed to showcase my skills and projects in a dynamic and engaging way. It's built from the ground up with a focus on modern web animations, smooth user experience, and interactive design.

## ✨ Key Features

This portfolio isn't just a static page; it's a complete user experience with a range of advanced features:

-   **🎨 Custom Animated Cursor:** A dual-ring cursor that provides interactive feedback on hoverable elements.
-   **💥 Text Dissolve Loading Animation:** An immersive loading screen where the initial text shatters into particles.
-   **🌊 Physics-Based Smooth Scrolling:** A fluid, inertia-based scrolling experience that glides through the different sections of the page.
-   **🎬 Full-Screen Page Transitions:** A seamless, app-like transition system that uses a lightning-blue screen wipe to move between the main page and project detail pages.
-   **✨ Interactive Project Showcase:**
    -   An animated project list with a text-fill hover effect.
    -   A dynamic image preview that follows the user's hover position.
    -   Dedicated project detail pages with a "scrollytelling" layout.
-   **🌌 GSAP Sticky Image Layout:** Inside the project detail pages, images animate and stick to the viewport as the user scrolls through the corresponding descriptions, creating a narrative-driven showcase.
-   **粒子 Particle Animation Background:** A subtle, animated particle background that adds depth and movement to the hero section.
-   **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** The entire experience is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using a combination of foundational web technologies and advanced animation libraries.

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, including custom properties (variables), complex layouts (Flexbox, Grid), and keyframe animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, DOM manipulation, and feature logic, written in a modern, class-based structure.
-   **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/):** Used for all high-performance animations, including the page transitions and the "scrollytelling" sticky image layout via the **ScrollTrigger** plugin.
